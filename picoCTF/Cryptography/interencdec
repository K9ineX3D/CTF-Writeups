Caesar Cipher Challenge - PicoCTF Writeup

👉 What I Found
Downloaded the enc_flag file and opened it. Looked like encrypted data, so I threw it into CyberChef to see what I was dealing with.
Multiple Base64 Layers

🔓 First decode:
Original: YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyZzBOMm8yYXpZNWZRPT0nCg==
Base64 decode: b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2g0N2o2azY5fQ=='
Still looked like base64, so I decoded again.

🔓 Second decode:
After removing 'b': d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2g0N2o2azY5fQ==
Base64 decode: wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_h47j6k69}

Now it looked like a flag format but the text was gibberish. The { and } brackets suggested this was close to the real flag

Caesar Cipher Analysis:
Went to dcode.fr and tried Caesar cipher decode. The tool showed:

🠞7 (🠜19): picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_a47c6d69}


▶️ What the numbers mean:
The Arrow Notation Explained

🠞7 = Shift RIGHT by 7 positions (encryption direction)
🠜19 = Shift LEFT by 19 positions (decryption direction)

Why Both Numbers Work
Caesar cipher uses modulo 26 arithmetic (26 letters in alphabet):
Left shift by 19 = Right shift by (26-19) = Right shift by 7
Right shift by 7 = Left shift by (26-7) = Left shift by 19

➕➖The Math✖️➗:
Original: w → Shift left 19 → p
or
Original: w → Shift right 7 → p

w = position 23 in alphabet (counting from 0)
p = position 16 in alphabet

Forward: (23 + 7) % 26 = 30 % 26 = 4... wait, that's wrong
Backward: (23 - 19) % 26 = 4 % 26 = 4... also wrong

Actually: w(22) - 7 = 15 = p ✓
Or: w(22) + 19 = 41, 41 % 26 = 15 = p ✓
Dcode's Display Logic

🠞7 shows the encryption shift (how original was encoded)
🠜19 shows the decryption shift (what you need to decode it)
Both give same result because 7 + 19 = 26

🪜🪜 Step-by-Step Solution:::
1. enc_flag file → Base64 decode → Another base64 string
2. Remove 'b' prefix → Base64 decode again → Scrambled flag  
3. Caesar cipher with shift -7 (or +19) → Real flag

🚀 Attack Summary:
Triple encoding layers:

Base64 (twice)
Caesar cipher (shift 7)

The challenge used multiple common encoding methods stacked together. Each decode revealed the next layer until hitting the plaintext flag.
