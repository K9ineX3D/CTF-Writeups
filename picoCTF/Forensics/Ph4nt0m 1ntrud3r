In this challenge we are given a .pcap file and goal is to find the flag

Open it in wireshark and there is only 22 packets present.
While analyzing packets, some caught my eye which contain base64 encoded strings in the data.

Frame 1: bnRfdGg0dA== → nt_th4t
Frame 8: YmhfNHJfMw== → bh_4r_3
Frame 12: NmY0YTY2Ng== → 6f4a666
Frame 13: XzM0c3lfdA== → _34sy_t
Frame 17: ezF0X3c0cw== → {1t_w4s
Frame 20: cGljb0NURg== → picoCTF

Organizing these pieces gave us the flag:

picoCTF{1t_w4snt_th4t_34sy_tbh_4r_36f4a666}
