Catagory - Forensic
Difficulty - Easy

In this challenge we are given a .pcap file and goal is to find the flag

Open it in wireshark and there is only 22 packets present.
While analyzing packets, some caught my eye which contain base64 encoded strings in the data.

Frame 6: ezF0X3c0cw== - {1t_w4s
Frame 11: MzE4ZGIyMg== - 318db22
Frame 14: XzM0c3lfdA== - _34sy_t
Frame 17: cGljb0NURg== - picoCTF
Frame 19: YmhfNHJfZg== - bh_4r_f
Frame 20: bnRfdGg0dA== - nt_th4t

Organizing these pieces gave us the flag:

picoCTF{1t_w4snt_th4t_34sy_tbh_4r_f318db22}
