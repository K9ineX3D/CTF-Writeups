**Challenge Overview**\
Got a website with a simple circuit builder interface for creating NAND gate circuits. The page had input1, input2, and output connections, plus some source code to examine.

## Initial Testing ðŸ§ª
Started by connecting the circuit components and hitting "Submit Circuit". Got a "wrong answer" popup every time - not very helpful! ðŸ˜¤\
The interface seemed straightforward enough, but clearly there was something I was missing about how to properly build the circuit.
## The Breakthrough ðŸ’¡
After getting frustrated with the wrong answers, I decided to try a different approach.\
Instead of just submitting right away, I built my circuit as usual.\
Clicked "Play Animation" first ðŸŽ¬\
Then clicked "Submit Circuit"

## The Exploit âš¡
When I followed this sequence, the popup that came up actually contained the flag! But here's the weird part - it didn't work consistently. I had to repeat this process multiple times:

**Play Animation â†’ Submit Circuit**\
**Play Animation â†’ Submit Circuit**\
**Play Animation â†’ Submit Circuit**

Eventually after doing this several times, the flag appeared in one of the popups instead of the usual "wrong answer" message.

## What Actually Happened? ðŸ¤”
To be completely honest, I'm not entirely sure what the underlying vulnerability was. It seemed like some kind of race condition or timing issue between the animation and submission process.\
I tried digging into the source code to understand the root cause, but couldn't figure out the exact mechanism. Even searched for other writeups but didn't find any detailed explanations of this specific behavior.

## The Flag ðŸš©
After multiple attempts with the Play Animation â†’ Submit sequence:\
**Flag: picoCTF{p4ch1nk0_f146_0n3_e947b9d7}**
